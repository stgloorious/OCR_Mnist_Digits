## @package train
# Takes training data provided via a local path and prepares the data to be used by the neural network. Provides status messages.
#
# Training data is supposed to be in .csv format, where every digit is represented by a new line.
# Pixel values are in greyscale between 0 and 255. First value of every new line (new digit) is 
# its label (value that it is supposed to be representing).

## Trains the neural network
#   @param neural_network The neural network object that should be trained
#   @param training_data_path Path to the .csv file that contains the training data. First entry must be label.
#   @param epochs Number of iterations the whole training set is used for training (repeated training)
