# OCR_Mnist_Digits
### Demonstration of handwritten digit recognition with a neural network. Uses Mnist data set.

**Based on a book by Tariq Rashid "Neurale Netzwerke selbst programmieren" (Ãœbersetzung Frank Langenau, O'Reilly).**

**Their Github can be found [here](https://github.com/makeyourownneuralnetwork/makeyourownneuralnetwork).**

The model is first trained with a dataset of 60'000 samples of labeled, handwritten digits.
After that, it is tested with a labeled set containing 10'000 unseen samples. 
**Some falsely identified digits are displayed** and a performance rating is given. **Typical accuracy is about 95 %**.
